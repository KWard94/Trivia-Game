<!-- first i will need to build my html structure -->
<!-- I will ensure every file is properly linked and can be sent to GH -->
<!-- this will include a div for the game game-window -->
<!-- also this will include empty  div for the questions to populate -->
<!-- I will also need to have a container for my answers as buttons to interact, or possibly as generic a/b/c/d buttons, depending. -->
<!-- The html file will likely be short and sweet, with most of the content in the js file.  -->
<!-- most of the content (questions and answers) will be stored in the js file in objects or arrays -->
